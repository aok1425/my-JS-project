# Steps

#### Next steps
- [ ] skim the resources in the 2 sections below to get a broad overview of what you'll learn next. then read the interesting bits.
- [ ] set specific, manageable goals for the end of the week, and fill out the section below

#### Next week goals (to finish by YY/YY/YYYY):
- [ ] goal 1 (e.g. go through chapters X, Y, Z in book A)
- [ ] goal 2
- [ ] goal 3

#### Decide collaboratively what website you want to build out
- [ ] decide on content
  - a site with static content is fine for your first website
    - one idea is a single-page application with each Smite character like a baseball card that you can flip around, telling its stats, etc.
    - you can also have the card contents be automatically filled out by pulling from some API, or in a more time-consuming method, by scraping the contents off of a site and putting it into a database.
  - ideally it provides some kind of functionality, solves some problem for the end-user
    - see examples here: https://hackbrightacademy.com/blog/29-web-apps-created-in-4-weeks-by-hackbright-academys-spring-2015-software-engineers/
