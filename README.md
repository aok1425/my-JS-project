#### Learn JS for front-end
- some JS learning resources:
  - https://sivers.org/learn-js
  - http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery
  - https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1

  - Henry might know which of the resources mentioned are best
  - I can give a $500 allowance on books. Just lmk which ones you buy.
- [ ] commit some app that shows you know the material **($100)**

#### Decide collaboratively what website you want to build out
(You don't need to decide on your webapp now, since it will take a while to learn the JS "well-enough", so I'm moving this section down.)
- [ ] decide on content
  - a site with static content is fine for your first website
    - one idea is a single-page application with each Smite character like a baseball card that you can flip around, telling its stats, etc.
    - you can also have the card contents be automatically filled out by pulling from some API, or in a more time-consuming method, by scraping the contents off of a site and putting it into a database.
  - ideally it provides some kind of functionality, solves some problem for the end-user
    - see examples here: https://hackbrightacademy.com/blog/29-web-apps-created-in-4-weeks-by-hackbright-academys-spring-2015-software-engineers/

#### Learn Python or Ruby on Rails or Ruby + Sinatra or Express.js for back-end **($100)**
- [ ] chat with Henry to get a better idea which one to use

#### Create "Hello, World" website **($230)**
- [ ] commit that website to this repo
